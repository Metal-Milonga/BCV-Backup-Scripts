##### This config file is used with the
#####	/usr/local/bin/bcvscripts/bin/BCV-Est.sh script.
#####
##### It is the default config file.
#####
##### Use of this file:
#####
##### If you are going to run the BCV-Est.sh script and need different settings
##### please make a copy of this file and edit it according to your needs.
#####
##### YOUR COPY OF THIS FILE MUST BE IN: /usr/local/bin/bcvscripts/etc
#####
##### Use the -C config-file-name option.  See the BCV-Est man page or enter
##### BCV-Est.sh --help to see the command syntax.
#####
##### Every line in the config file is needed by the script.
##### Copy the entire config file and edit only the lines you need to change.
#####
##### Each line follows the same format: IDENTIFIER:item1,item2,itemN
##### The script greps for the Identifier and uses the items listed.
##### DO NOT adjust the name of the IDENTIFIER

##### List the valid servers that BCVs are established against.
##### If it is not on this line the script will fail.
#####
BCV_SERVERS:server09,server16,server20

##### The -B option to run backups needs to keep track of how many scripts are
##### running.  This allows it to create a file to keep track of which
##### filesystems are ready for backup.  This line would match the number of
##### servers entered in crontab.  Most of the time, if you are running the
##### script manually, you will not want to run the backup option (-B), so you
##### will not need to adjust this line. You should start the backup manually.

##### Split Times. Because of special operations that Data Services does
##### we need to delay the split until certain times of the day.
##### Put the time in the format HH:MM:SS, so 6am is 06:00:00

##### This section lists, by server, the volumegroups associated with
##### EMC Symmetrix Device Groups.  i.e. VG vgfoobarprod1 goes with DG foobar1.
##### The File Systems have to be unmounted, and the Volume Groups have to be
##### deactivated before the Establish takes place.  The script gets all it's
##### information from the volumegroup name.
#####
##### The VG and DG lists that start with an X are to identify to the script
##### which VGs and DGs need to have an -xact establish performed on them.
##### You only need to do an -exact establish when disks are added to a VG and
##### the related Device Group. It only needs to be run this way the first time
##### after adding the disks.  After that the VG and DG names can go back on
##### the normal line.  ALL VGs that are listed on the X line will be
##### VGExported and VGImported in addition to being unmounted and deactivated.

##### OmniBackup Jobs and associated filesystems:
##### This section lists the OmniBackup job identifier and filesystems backed
