Split_BCVs_NOHOTBCKUP() {
#
# Function - Split_BCVs_NOHOTBCKUP
# Version - 1.05
# Author - David Holton
# Date - March 23, 2003
#
# Description - This function will initiate the split of the BCVs. This
#		funciton cantains two functions within it:
#
#		The Split_The_BCVs loop calls the Start and Stop Hot Backup
#		scripts for the Oracle databases.  In between Starting
#		and Stopping Oracle Hot Backup mode, it performs the BCV split
#		for the appropriate EMC Device Groups.
#
#		If the -W option is used to start the BCV-Est.sh script, then
#		this function will wait until the Split time defined in the 
#		configuration file before actually splitting the BCVs. This is
#		accomplished by the second function. It makes use of the
#		Determine_Split_Wait function to find the right about of time
#		to sleep until it is time to perform the split.

# Modification history
# Date     Who          What was modified.
# -------- ------------ ------------------
# 05/23/02 Dave Holton	Edited the Wait_To_Split_Loop to run the new
#			Determine_Split_Wait function, and edited the line in
#			the Wait_To_Split_Loop that calls the Time_Counter to
#			use the value of $COUNT_TIME returned from the
#			Determine_Split_Wait function.
# 05/24/02 Dave Holton	In the Wait_To_Split_Loop, changed the comparison of
#			current time and split time to use >= instead of >
# 07/09/02 Dave Holton	Commented out reports of indivitual splits from going
#			to the email report. Also, lines regarding the wait
#			state and when the split time is set to.
# 11/26/02 Dave Holton	Added code to check for a SPLIT_LOCK file.  If the file
#			is present, then another instance of the script is
#			running a split routine. In that case, sleep for 900
#			seconds and check again. If the file is not there then
#			it is okay to split the BCVs, but first we touch the
#			SPLIT_LOCK file so no other instances will error out
#			while we are splitting.  Once we are finished, the 
#			script removes the SPLIT_LOCK FILE.
# 11/29/02 Dave Holton	Moved the SPLIT_LOCK logic inside the Split_The_BCVs
#			internal function.  Then it is only executed when an
#			instance of the script is ready to split.
# 03/23/03 Dave Holton	This version has the call to the start and stop Oracle
#			Hot Backup mode, commented out.  This is for doing
#			manual establish and splits until I can get a version
#			with a commandline switch build.
